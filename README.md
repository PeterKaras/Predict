# Predict
Predict-LineLoss is a machine learning project dedicated to predicting line loss in electrical power systems. By leveraging advanced algorithms and comprehensive datasets, we aim to provide accurate predictions, enabling utilities to optimize their operations, reduce waste, and improve overall system efficiency.

All models are comprehensively detailed in this document: https://kinit.sk/creating-a-predictive-model-for-electricity-transmission-losses/
